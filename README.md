# fakecsv

This was just a quick [Deno](https://deno.com/) script I threw together in a few minutes using [Faker.js](https://fakerjs.dev/) to create some sample data for a non-technical user working on an assignment for a database design class.

To run (will create two `*-fakes-*.csv` files in the working directory):

```sh
deno run --allow-write index.js
```
